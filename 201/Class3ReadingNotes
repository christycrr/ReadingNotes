"HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content" 
"Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or between websites."
"HTML uses "markup" to annotate text, images, and other content for display in a Web browser. HTML markup includes special "elements" such as <head>, <title>, <body>, <header>, <footer>, <article>, <section>, <p>, <div>, <span>, <img>, <aside>, <audio>, <canvas>, <datalist>, <details>, <embed>, <nav>, <output>, <progress>, <video>, <ul>, <ol>, <li> and many others.

An HTML element is set off from other text in a document by "tags", which consist of the element name surrounded by "<" and ">". The name of an element inside a tag is case insensitive. That is, it can be written in uppercase, lowercase, or a mixture. For example, the <title> tag can be written as <Title>, <TITLE>, or in any other way. However, the convention and recommended practice is to write tags in lowercase."

"<ol>: The Ordered List element
The <ol> HTML element represents an ordered list of items â€” typically rendered as a numbered list."
<ul>: The Unordered List element
The <ul> HTML element represents an unordered list of items, typically rendered as a bulleted list."
