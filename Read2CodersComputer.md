Terminal "A command line, or terminal, is a text based interface to the system. You are able to enter commands by typing them on the keyboard and feedback will be given to you similarly as text." "Here's your first shortcut. When you enter commands, they are actually stored in a history. You can traverse this history using the up and down arrow keys. So don't bother re-typing out commands you have previously entered, you can usually just hit the up arrow a few times." "PWD. It tells you what your current or present working directory is. " "Absolute paths specify a location (file or directory) in relation to the root directory. You can identify them easily as they always begin with a forward slash ( / ) Relative paths specify a location (file or directory) in relation to where we currently are in the system. They will not begin with a slash." "~ (tilde) - This is a shortcut for your home directory. eg, if your home directory is /home/ryan then you could refer to the directory Documents with the path /home/ryan/Documents or ~/Documents . (dot) - This is a reference to your current directory. eg in the example above we referred to Documents on line 4 with a relative path. It could also be written as ./Documents (Normally this extra bit is not required but in later sections we will see where it comes in handy). .. (dotdot)- This is a reference to the parent directory. You can use this several times in a path to keep going up the hierarchy. eg if you were in the path /home/ryan you could run the command ls ../../ and this would do a listing of the root directory." "If you run the command cd without any arguments then it will always take you back to your home directory." "A file extension is normally a set of 2 - 4 characters after a full stop at the end of a file, which denotes what type of file it is. The following are common extensions:

file.exe - an executable file, or program. file.txt - a plain text file. file.png, file.gif, file.jpg - an image." "Anything inside quotes is considered a single item." "What the backslash does is escape (or nullify) the special meaning of the next character." Here is a list of some basic terminal commands! cd = Change Directory
