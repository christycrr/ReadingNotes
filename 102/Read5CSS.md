There are three ways of inserting a style sheet:

External CSS
Internal CSS
Inline CSS
Note: Do not add a space between the property value and the unit:
Incorrect (space): margin-left: 20 px;
Correct (nospace): margin-left: 20px;
Internal CSS
An internal style sheet may be used if one single HTML page has a unique style.

The internal style is defined inside the <style> element, inside the head section.
